prepare reshape test on the physical platform + behavoir of merge (droplet-aware), use the droplet reshape gui and send the command each step.

consider adding an attribute to modules, "1 at a time" (e.g. for sensors). Hence, the droplet does not need to fit within the module.

kig mere pï¿½ deadlock (prevention)

greedy router change probabilities on deadlock (droplet moving to module can deadlock atm, if another modules blocks, because the droplet selects the best move, aka. Move.None, adding probabilities will fix this deadlock)
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)

non-uniform split "simulator"

waste operation (variable droplet size)            

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

husk javadocs!
