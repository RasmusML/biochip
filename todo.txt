// @TODO: make sure the shape fits into the module. (get width, height, otherwise) if this does not help, terminate.

use the reshape algorithm (greedy router)

fix constraintschecker on merge, it is outdated?

waste operation (variable droplet size)            

greedy router change probabilities on deadlock (droplet moving to module can deadlock atm, if another modules blocks, because the droplet selects the best move, aka. Move.None, adding probabilities will fix this deadlock)
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

// @TODO: build verboseBioAssay from bioAssay (with merge, move etc...)
- Create an update Graphviz, when the routing is (how long does each operation take, or start and stop time for operation)
