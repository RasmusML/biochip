module allocation (work on selecting module)
use the reshape algorithm (greedy router)

fix constraintschecker on merge, it is outdated?

// @TODO: make sure the shape fits into the module. (get width, height, otherwise) if this does not help, terminate.

waste operation (variable droplet size)            

greedy router change probabilities on deadlock
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)


fix: when a droplet spawn and has no succeding operation, then the color of the droplet is blue (dispense), but it should be gray
fix: timeline arrows not correct length, when droplets only do a dispense and nothing else
flatten timeline by using the same y-value for continues "single" operation

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

// @TODO: build verboseBioAssay from bioAssay (with merge, move etc...)
- Create an update Graphviz, when the routing is (how long does each operation take, or start and stop time for operation)
