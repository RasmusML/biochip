// @TODO: make sure the shape fits into the module. (get width, height, otherwise) if this does not help, terminate.

waste operation (variable droplet size)
            
kig mere pï¿½ deadlock (prevention)

greedy router change probabilities on deadlock (droplet moving to module can deadlock atm, if another modules blocks, because the droplet selects the best move, aka. Move.None, adding probabilities will fix this deadlock)
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)


prepare reshape test on the physical platform + behavoir of merge (droplet-aware)

non-uniform split "simulator"

run test suite with different seeds to ensure we find a solution + get better estimates for execution times.

waste operation (variable droplet size)            

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

// @TODO: build verboseBioAssay from bioAssay (with merge, move etc...)
- Create an update Graphviz, when the routing is (how long does each operation take, or start and stop time for operation)
