consider adding an attribute to modules, "1 at a time" (e.g. for sensors). Hence, the droplet does not need to fit within the module.

kig mere pï¿½ deadlock (prevention)

non-uniform split "simulator"

waste operation (variable droplet size)            

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

husk javadocs!
