prepare reshape test on the physical platform + behavoir of merge (droplet-aware)

run test suite with different seeds to ensure we find a solution + get better estimates for execution times.

kig mere p� deadlock (prevention)

greedy router change probabilities on deadlock (droplet moving to module can deadlock atm, if another modules blocks, because the droplet selects the best move, aka. Move.None, adding probabilities will fix this deadlock)
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)

non-uniform split "simulator"

waste operation (variable droplet size)            

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

husk javadocs!
