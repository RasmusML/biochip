greedy router change probabilities on deadlock
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)
create tests with the real platform dimensions (rows=20, cols=32)

module allocation (work on selecting module)

fix: when a droplet spawn and has no succeding operation, then the color of the droplet is blue (dispense), but it should be gray
fix: timeline arrows not correct length, when droplets only do a dispense and nothing else

waste operation (variable droplet size)
use the reshape algorithm (greedy router)

add droplet sizes on edges (graphviz)

// @TODO: look into splitting a droplet into smaller, maybe extra operation option ("optimization")

// @TODO: build verboseBioAssay from bioAssay (with merge, move etc...)
- Create an update Graphviz, when the routing is (how long does each operation take, or start and stop time for operation)
