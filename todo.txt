General:
waste operation
greedy router change probabilities on deadlock
probabilities for all moves (greedy router) (also move to module operation)
create tests with the real platform dimensions (rows=20, cols=32)

use the reshape algorithm

// @TODO: build verboseBioAssay from bioAssay (with merge, move etc...)

- Create an update Graphviz, when the routing is (how long does each operation take, or start and stop time for operation)
